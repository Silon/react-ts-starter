<h1 align="center">React SPA Starter with Typescript</h1>
<p align="center">
Project made with ❤️ and based on experience.
</p>

## 🛒 Tech Stack

- React
- Typescript
- Redux-Toolkit
- CSS Modules

## 🚀 Quick Start

```ts
  yarn install && yarn start
```

## 💊 Icons

To add a new icon, put svg file into `src/assets/icons` and use the naming convention `icon-[ICON_NAME]`. Remember to
make sure all stroke and/or fills are set to **currentColor** unless you are sure that's not what
you want. Finally, run this command and your icon will be available. List of all icons is autogenerated in `docs/icons-list.html`. You can quickly open by command

```ts
// Generate icons map and types
  yarn icons

// Open list of icons
  yarn icons-preview
```

## ⚙ CLI Generating

Some parts of application may be automatically generated by plop.

### Components

Generated component will be placed inside `src/components` directory

### Reducers

Generated reducer will be placed inside `src/redux` directory and automatically added to reducers list in `combineReducers` in `src/redux/reducers.ts`.
Reducer can be [persisted](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) and if you want to use this feature you have to confirm it after command run.

```ts
// Generate new component
  yarn new-component [name]

// Generate new reducer
  yarn new-reducer [name]
```
