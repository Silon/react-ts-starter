</p>

## 🛒 Tech Stack

- React
- Typescript
- Redux-Toolkit
- SCSS Modules

## 🚀 Quick Start

```ts
  yarn install && yarn start
```

## 💊 Icons

To add new icon, put svg file into `src/assets/icon` and use naming convention `icon-[name]`.
Make sure that all colors are set to **currentColor** and run generating command.
All your icons are listed as object with svg components in `src/components/_icons/icons.map.tsx`. Name type is generated in `src/components/_icons/icons.types.ts` and contain list of all available icons names.
You can preview all icons by running preview command or directly open `docs/icons-list.html` in your browser.

```ts
// Generate icons map and types
  yarn icons

// Open list of icons
  yarn icons-preview
```

## ⚙ CLI Generating

Some parts of application may be automatically generated by plop.

### Components

Generated component will be placed inside `src/components` directory

### Reducers

Generated reducer will be placed inside `src/redux` directory and automatically added to reducers list in `combineReducers` in `src/redux/reducers.ts`.
Reducer can be [persisted](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) and if you want to use this feature you have to confirm it after command run.

```ts
// Generate new component
  yarn new-component [name]

// Generate new reducer
  yarn new-reducer [name]
```
